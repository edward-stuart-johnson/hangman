# Hangman

   ## Description
   Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain number of attempts.
   This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess it. 
   
   > The project aims to combine the skills I have learned about object-orientated programming, logic, loops, and functions.

##   Future ideas
1. allow the user to input words for the list that the program randomly chooses from before the game begins.
1. allow the user to choose premade categories of word lists.
1. have the computer be the guesser.
1. have a GUI.
