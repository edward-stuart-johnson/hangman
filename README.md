# Hangman

   ## Description
   Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
   This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. *A future idea: have the computer be the guesser.*
   
   >The aim of the project is to to bring together the skills I have learnt about object-orientated programming, logic, loops, and functions.
